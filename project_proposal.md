What data sources are you using?
    We are using Mount Rainier Weather and Climbing Data from Kaggle. This dataset includes two csv files: Climbing Statistics & Rainier Weather. 

Whatâ€™s the end product you want to create?
    Our end product will be two tables that can be queried e.g. success rate for a certain climbing route in a given month. 

How will you store it?
    We will store it in a SQL database

How will you transform the data?
    Using pandas to transform the data, we will drop unwanted columns, rename columns, set indexes, and set up primary keys. 

What additional challenges will you give yourself if you have time?
    If we have time, we will scrape https://www.summitpost.org/mount-rainier/150291#chapter_6 for individual route data using pandas, and import this table into our SQL database.
